#### By _**Jacob W, Matt C, Aaron M, Albert L**_

#### _Practice writing functional code in JavaScript using problems on ProjectEuler._

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _JavaScript_
* _CSS_
* _Markdown_
* _Bootstrap_
* _JQuery_
* _Jest_
* _Webpack_
* _Lint_

## Description

_Practicing functional programming in JavaScript. Each problem is stored in a different file in src/js. Functions prioritize pure code, currying, recursion, and closures._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You can find the github repository [here](https://github.com/JLEWilson/functional-project-euler)_
* _Click the code button, and copy the https link_
* _In your in git bash or your preferred git terminal navigate to the directory you would like to store the project_
